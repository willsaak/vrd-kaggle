Submissions are evaluated by computing the weighted mean of three metrics: mean Average Precision (mAP) on relationships detection, Recall@N (where N=50), mean Average Precision on phrase detection (mean in mean Average Precision is taken over per-relationship APs).
The weights applied to each of the 3 metrics are [0.4, 0.2, 0.4].

We (rakede🚀) achieved 0.04671 score, 55 place and bronze medal🏅.
